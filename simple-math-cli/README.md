This is a simple CLI that takes in 3 arguments, the method name, and two either integers or doubled that the method transforms. The method options are: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.

This console application is testing my ability to created methods for the Program class. I wanted the user to be able to utilize the methods by passing arguments through the CLI.
